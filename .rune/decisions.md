## [2026-03-21 16:00] Decision: Use remark-gfm for markdown table rendering

**Context:** CarabinerOS chat rendered markdown tables as raw pipe-delimited text instead of formatted HTML tables
**Decision:** Added remark-gfm plugin to ReactMarkdown and CSS table styles using existing theme variables
**Rationale:** GFM tables are not standard markdown — require remark-gfm plugin. CSS-only approach keeps it simple.
**Impact:** frontend/src/components/message-list.tsx, frontend/src/app/globals.css

## [2026-03-21 16:30] Decision: Use relative venv path for MCP config

**Context:** MCP carabiner_db command used absolute path to venv python, breaking portability across machines and Docker
**Decision:** Changed to `.venv/bin/python` (relative) in usr/settings.json, added settings.local.json pattern for overrides
**Rationale:** Docker uses `python` (system), local dev uses `.venv/bin/python`. Relative path works for local dev; Docker overrides via its own config.
**Impact:** usr/settings.json, .gitignore, usr/settings.local.json.example

## [2026-03-21 17:00] Decision: Unpinned litellm/openai/starlette in requirements.txt

**Context:** requirements.txt had `>=` floor pins that conflicted with exact pins in requirements2.txt (used by Docker)
**Decision:** Use unpinned entries (just package name) so requirements2.txt wins in Docker builds
**Rationale:** requirements2.txt is the authoritative source for Docker version pins. Our entries just ensure the packages are listed.
**Impact:** requirements.txt

## [2026-03-21 17:30] Decision: Single orchestrator pattern for Claude Code

**Context:** Running two Claude Code sessions on the same repo caused branch conflicts and file corruption
**Decision:** One Claude Code session at a time. Delegated agents use `isolation: "worktree"` for parallel work.
**Rationale:** Git has one working tree — concurrent checkouts corrupt each other's state.
**Impact:** Workflow pattern, not code. Saved in memory for future sessions.
